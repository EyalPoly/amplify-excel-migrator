# Workflow
- Be sure to typecheck when you’re done making a series of code changes

# Comments
- Only add comments/docstrings when they are truly needed to explain why something is done a certain way, not what is being done. Code should be self-explanatory as much as possible.

# Decision-Making
- Never make any claims about code before investigating unless you are certain—give grounded and hallucination-free answers.
